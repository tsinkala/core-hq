    You can optionally specify a template for the message that your CHWs receive upon successful
    submission of a form.
</p>
<p>
    In the template, you have access to the following variables gathered real-time from the server:
    $first_name, $name, $week, $today.
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>
    Thanks $first_name! You have submitted $today forms today and $week forms since Monday.
