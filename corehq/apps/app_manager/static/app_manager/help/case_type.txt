The value you set for "Case Type" will be the name for the type of case that this module uses. If you are creating an application for the first time,
you can name the case type whatever you like. If you want to be able to interface with the cases of other modules,
you will have to use the same name for the case type. When you view the case data online, it will be organized by
case type.

Perhaps you will have one case called "<code>pregnant_mother</code>", and another called "<code>routine_patient</code>", etc.
