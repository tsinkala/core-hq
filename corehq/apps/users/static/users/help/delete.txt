<p>Deleting a user removes any record of them, including all of the forms they ever submitted and their
associated cases. We recommend only deleting users that never corresponded to real people to begin with,
such as users created while testing an application.</p>
<p>If you are unsure, it is safer to <strong>archive</strong> a user.</p>
