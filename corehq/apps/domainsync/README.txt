This app provides the functionality to keep a domain's documents in sync 
with another domain (master/slave). It also lets you apply a set of filters /
transforms on the documents so that you can, for example, deidentify personal
information. 

The original use case of this app is for creating a deidentified, "public" 
domain with content that is kept in sync with an existing domain.
