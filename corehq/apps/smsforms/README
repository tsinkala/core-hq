A simple app to play through forms in sms-style using the touchforms backend.

In order to load case data touchforms must authenticate with HQ. To allow this
you must specify the following two items in your settings:

TOUCHFORMS_API_USER = "changeme"
TOUCHFORMS_API_PASSWORD = "changeme"

The touchforms user needs to be created on HQ, as they must have both a django
account and a couch account. Additionally the user should be a superuser in 
order to access cases from any domain.

The basic structure of the code is:

models.py   Session object model
app.py      API for starting and interacting with touchforms sms sessions
signals.py  Catches signal from touchforms indicating form completion and posts
            the form to HQ.
